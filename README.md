This repository contains a few small machine learning projects that I completed

STROKE PREDICTOR

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data
Compiler: fedesoriano 

I predict using 10 different features: Gender, Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Marital Status, Work Type, Residence, Average Glucose Level, BMI, Smoking Status
